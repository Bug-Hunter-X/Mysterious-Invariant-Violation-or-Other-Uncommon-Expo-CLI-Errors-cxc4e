This solution focuses on providing a step-by-step debugging approach, rather than providing a specific code fix (as the error is highly context-dependent).

1. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:**
Start with a barebones Expo project.  Add components and features one at a time until the error reappears. This helps isolate the problematic section of your code.

2. **Check Expo and React Native Versions:**
Ensure your `package.json` reflects compatible versions of Expo and React Native. Refer to the Expo documentation for compatibility matrices.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:**
Run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo run:android` or `expo run:ios` to clear any cached build artifacts.

4. **Debug Async Operations:**
Use your IDE's debugging tools or `console.log` statements to carefully trace the execution flow of asynchronous operations.  Pay close attention to `Promise` handling and potential race conditions.

5. **Inspect Package.json for Conflicts:**
Review your dependencies in `package.json` for any potential version conflicts or known incompatibility issues.  Try updating or reverting packages as needed.

6. **Search for Solutions:**
Consult the Expo forums and GitHub issues for similar error reports. Search using descriptive terms from your original error message.

7. **Update Expo CLI:**
Make sure you're using the latest version: `npm install -g expo-cli`

Example debugging strategy (using `console.log`):

```javascript
// bug.js
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  console.log('Entering myAsyncFunction');
  try {
    // Your asynchronous code here
    const result = await someAsyncOperation();
    console.log('Result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in myAsyncFunction:', error);
  }
  console.log('Exiting myAsyncFunction');
}
```

By strategically using `console.log` statements at various points in your code, you can track the execution flow and pinpoint where the error occurs.
