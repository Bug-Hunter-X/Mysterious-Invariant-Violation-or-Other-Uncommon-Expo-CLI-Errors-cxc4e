# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors

This repository demonstrates how to diagnose and resolve cryptic errors encountered when using the Expo CLI. These errors often lack specific details in their error messages, making debugging challenging.

## Problem

The core problem revolves around unhandled exceptions and missing native modules while using Expo's various features. Typical error messages might indicate missing native components or conflicts within the asynchronous execution flow.  The underlying cause can vary widely.

## Solution

The solution presented here focuses on systematic debugging techniques. By creating a minimal reproducible example and incrementally adding features, we can pinpoint the exact source of the error.  The steps include:

1. **Verifying SDK Compatibility:** Matching the Expo SDK and React Native versions is crucial.
2. **Cleaning the Project:** Removing cached build artifacts helps in resolving issues stemming from stale files.
3. **Asynchronous Operation Analysis:** Careful examination of asynchronous code sections to identify race conditions or promise handling mistakes.
4. **Minimal Reproducible Example:** Creating a small project to reproduce the error in a simplified environment.
